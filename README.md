# Weather_App

This Python script creates a **Weather App** using the `tkinter` library for the GUI and the **OpenWeather API** to fetch real-time weather data. The app allows users to input a city name, which triggers an API request to retrieve weather information such as the temperature and weather description. The temperature is displayed in Celsius, and a weather icon is dynamically fetched and shown. 

The interface includes:
- An input field for the city name.
- Labels to display weather information and temperature.
- A weather icon that updates based on the cityâ€™s weather.
- Buttons to search for weather and reset the displayed data.

The app also handles errors like invalid city names or network issues gracefully.
